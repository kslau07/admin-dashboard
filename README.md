## Project description

Build a dashboard design using CSS Grid for the majority of the work.

The dashboard will contain:

+ a header
+ a sidebar
+ a main content area

## My goals for this project

My goal is to utilize most of the Grid techniques we've learned, such as:

+ the grid shorthand property
+ line-names, area-names,
+ repeat(), minmax(), auto-fit/fill, fit-content()
+ creating responsiveness without media queries
+ span, auto, fr
+ alignment techniques, eg, justify/align content/items
+ negative line-numbers

And I'll try to further my other css knowledge such as:

+ header responsiveness with flexbox
+ generating woff2 fonts from ttf fonts
+ other css units: `ch`, `em`, `ex`, `vw`, `vh`, `vmin`, `vmax`
+ other selectors: :is(), :where(), :has(), :not()
+ animations using css
+ textures for backgrounds using svgs
